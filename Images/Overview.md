###Overview:

All of the solutions files depict solutions by displaying a number at each location on the board that corresponds to the size of the tile covering that location. That's all very well for a computer but impossible to visualize for a human. I wrote a program ("colorize.py") that creates a color .PNG image file of any particular solution. The files "00240.png" and "01021.png" show the most and least fragmented solutions in glorious color.

For the hell of it, I created .PNG files for all 18,656 solutions and made a .AVI movie out of them. I used a program called "ImageJ" to do it and it was surprisingly easy. The resulting movies are, of course, astoundingly boring and I didn't bother uploading any of them.
