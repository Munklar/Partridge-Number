This Repository contains:

1. This TOC file

2. A README file with a problem description, some helpful links, and a current status of the project.

3. Python and Java source code for finding solutions to square Partridge Puzzles (see the README file). There are versions for Python v2.7.5, Python v3.5.2, and Java 8.

4. Python code ("postproc.py") for generating the data in the Analysis sub-folder (q.v.). It's pretty shabby code written with the assumption that it only needs to run once. (Sorry.)

5. A "Solutions" directory filled with solutions to square Partridge Puzzles of various sizes.

6. An "Analysis" directory filled with different ways of analyzing the 18,656 solutions to the N=8 Partridge Puzzle.
