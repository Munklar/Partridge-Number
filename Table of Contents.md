# This Repository Contains:

1. This TOC file

2. A README file with a problem description, some helpful links, and a current status of the project.

3. Python and Java source code for finding solutions to square Partridge and Trapridge Puzzles (see the README file). The Python programs (both of them) were my first attempt at writing a solution and lack the optimizations I added to the Java version.  
 * PartNum-Py2.7.5.py solves Partridge Puzzles for Python v2.7.5
 * PartNum-Py3.5.2.py solves Partridge Puzzles for Python v3.2.5
 * pn5.java solves Partridge Puzzles for Java 8
 * rn5.java is the same as pn5.java but starts by placing the biggest tiles first (rather than the smallest)
 * tr5.java solves Trapridge Puzzles for Java 8

4. A "Solutions" directory filled with solutions to square Partridge Puzzles of various sizes.

5. An "Analysis" directory filled with different ways of analyzing the 18,656 solutions to the N=8 Partridge Puzzle. 

6. An "Images" directory for the Python program that converts solutions into .PNG images, and a few of those .PNG images by way of example.
