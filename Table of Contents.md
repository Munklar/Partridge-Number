2. A README file with a problem description, some helpful links, and a current status of the project.

3. Python source code files for figuring out how to tile a square that is Nx(N+1)/2 units on each side with 1 tile that is 1x1, 2 tiles that are 2x2, ... and N tiles that are NxN. There's a version for Python v2.7.5 and for Python v3.5.2.
