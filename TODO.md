As of 12/11/16, here is the To-Do list:

1. Get the code running on a real desktop machine or beefy server. We could use some serious horsepower.

2. Decide whether it's worth porting to a newer version of Python. I vote no but could be persuaded I suppose. Maybe this is part of Step 1.

3. Decide whether it's worth porting to Java. I think this would be worth doing because I expect Java to significantly outperform Python. Plus it would help me learn Java.

4. In parallel with the above, write all the post-processing programs. See the open issues for a list and requirements.
