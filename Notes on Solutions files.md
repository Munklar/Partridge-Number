The "Solutions*.txt" files contain the output of an earlier version of the PartNum.py program. The solutions are all correct but the file doesn't have the current formatting on things like the total number of attempted configurations.

By the way, you can ignore the "Score" number in the output file. It was a quick and dirty attempt to measure, roughly, how fragmented the solution was. By "fragmented" I mean how often were tiles of the same size placed next to each other (which would have a high score and imply low fragmentation). But the approach I used is badly flawed.
